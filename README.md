# Submarine Search
Game developed for CSCI-C292, 4 November 2020.

In this spin on the itch.io game known as "Rocket Raze" by Helix9, you are in the depths of the ocean searching for the sunken treasure! Point and click your way to the top towards to treasure to move to the next level,
but be aware of the fish of the deep because if they hit you... it's right back to the beginning!

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.2

- For the fish/schools of fish: https://kenney.nl/assets/fish-pack (Links to an external site.)

- For the background, I decided to change what I originally had because it didn't look right. It was too static, so instead I used this which was created by Spiney and it's posted on opengameart.org.
  The author left a comment on his submission of this asset that said we are able to use whichever liscensing suits our needs, but I felt I should still attribute him.
